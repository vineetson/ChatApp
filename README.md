## Introduction

This is a Microsoft Teams clone built with React JS and [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io)!

React JS is the programming language of choice, and Chat Engine is a set of APIs and UI Kit specific to chat.

It's a good example of learning to react and creating something production-ready!

## Let's dive into the features of the chat application:
# Login screen with username and password
# Chat rooms
# List of people available in the chat room
# Online/offline status
# Sound notification for new messages
# Real-time messaging

## Conclusion: 
1. Creating a React application and installing dependencies.
2. Creating components for the chat application, such as the chat feed, message form, and message.
3. Implementing read receipts for messages using a function that maps over the people who have read the message and renders a small icon next to their name.
