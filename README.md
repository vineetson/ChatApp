## Introduction

This is a Microsoft Teams clone built with React JS and [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io)!

React JS is the programming language of choice, and Chat Engine is a set of APIs and UI Kit specific to chat.

Its a good example of learning react and creating something production ready!

Let's  dives into the features of the chat application:

Login screen with username and password
Chat rooms
List of people available in the chat room
Online/offline status
Sound notification for new messages
Real-time messaging

Conclusion: 
Creating a React application and installing dependencies
Creating components for the chat application, such as the chat feed, message form, and message
Implementing read receipts for messages using a function that maps over the people who have read the message and renders a small icon next to their name
